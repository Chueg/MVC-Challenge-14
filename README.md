# Model View Controller


## Description

The purpose of this project was to get a full understanding on how to make routes and utilize them to make a complex website. This was a very important exercise, I have learned so much including how to make a database that can store encoded user information and have a successful login/signup page.

This dashboard shows the users posts and gives them the option to make a new post or update/delete their previous posts.

Navigating to a previously created post will give the user the option to leave a comment. Leaving a comment will show up underneath the post.
